# DNS_Reputation_Analysis_Tool
DNS Reputation Analysis Tool replays DNS traffic from PCAP files, extracts domains, and checks their reputation via an API. It supports high-concurrency lookups with caching, timeouts, retries, and rate limiting. Real-time monitoring tracks QPS, errors, and response times, while results and summaries are saved in CSV/JSON.
